<p>We have recently updated our homepage with a new style. If you click the "Download Now" link, you will be directed to the correct download page for your browser. At the moment, we are unable to offer download links for Chrome or Opera, but we are working on publishing those to their relevant stores.</p>
<p>Right now, we have not yet started working on CatBlock for Firefox, and it seems that, as the AdBlock Firefox extension is quite new, many changes will be made before the code is as stable as on Chrome, as they work on a different codebase, as Firefox extensions are substantially different to Chrome ones, and we would have to work with updates to that as well.</p>
