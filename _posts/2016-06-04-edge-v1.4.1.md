We've released CatBlock for Edge version 1.4.1!

This fixes a few bugs with the original version we released, including:

- Added context menu options (Pause/Unpause CatBlock; Options page)
- Move from extension.getURL to runtime.getURL API<!--more-->
- Move from the deprecated extension.sendRequest/onRequest to runtime.sendMessage/onMessage
- Updates to the port.js file (reflecting the API changes)
- Updated jQuery and jQuery UI libraries
- Updated punycode.js library
- Changed Options page behaviour
- Updated translations
- Fixed selecting certain options on General tab

This has also been released for Chrome and Safari, so that users of those versions
can make sure that the changes we're making for Edge aren't affecting them at all.

The changes should be fine, but if you ever notice a bug,
[report it](https://github.com/CatBlock/catblock/issues) to us straight away!

Also, we've been working on making it possible to release a beta-testing version of
CatBlock with code we've been working on, as we work on it, thanks to the magic of
Continuous Integration!
