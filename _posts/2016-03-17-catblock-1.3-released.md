Hello!

We are so pleased to announce the next version of CatBlock is finally out! We've reworked the ad replacement code to show you more cats, and it even works on YouTube!

In other news, CatBlock 1.3 updates the AdBlock core to version 2.50, bringing with it the latest features and fixes from the AdBlock team, and there's a checkbox on the options page to let you turn off the ad replacement, letting you go back to just regular AdBlock, for when you've got that presentation you're making and don't want cats taking over the projector.

As you may also have noticed, the blog's gotten a new look! We're now on the main CatBlock site, thanks to the awesomeness that is GitHub Pages and the Jekyll blog generator. Also thanks to Tomáš for helping me fix some of the bugs I introduced when migrating the old site over!

Finally, thank YOU for using CatBlock. We'd probably do this anyway, but having people like you really help us know where to focus our efforts!
