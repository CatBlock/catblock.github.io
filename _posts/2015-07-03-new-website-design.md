<p>Our old site, based around this blog, has been completely updated and redesigned thanks to our lead developer Tom&aacute;&scaron;. It now loads faster and doesn't crash as much! We'll be adjusting the blog to be even more awesome than before!</p>
<p>If you want to check out the source, see our <a href="https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;CatBlock&#47;website">GitHub page<&#47;a> for it. Also, if anyone has skills with PHP, then adjusting our theme to make a WordPress Theme for the blog would be awesome! Get in touch with us through our email: <a href="mailto:catblockteam@gmail.com">catblockteam AT gmail.com<&#47;a> or to me personally: <a href="mailto:kieran@catblock.tk">kieran AT catblock.tk<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>Also, for those who don't know, we like to keep you all informed of what we're doing. We've got a Trello board where we discuss everything, and an IRC channel (#catblock on Freenode) where you'll often find someone in the team online, as long as you're not from Australia, as the whole team is from Europe. (Even so, I've got a bot online regularly)</p>
