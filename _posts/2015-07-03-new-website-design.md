Our old site, based around this blog, has been completely updated and redesigned thanks to our lead developer Tom&aacute;&scaron;. It now loads faster and doesn't crash as much! We'll be adjusting the blog to be even more awesome than before!

<!--more-->

If you want to check out the source, see our [GitHub page](https://github.com/CatBlock/website) for it. Also, if anyone has skills with PHP, then adjusting our theme to make a WordPress Theme for the blog would be awesome! Get in touch with us through our email: [catblockteam AT gmail.com](mailto:catblockteam@gmail.com) or to me personally: [kieran AT catblock.tk](mailto:kieran@catblock.tk).

Also, for those who don't know, we like to keep you all informed of what we're doing. We've got a Trello board where we discuss everything, and an IRC channel (#catblock on Freenode) where you'll often find someone in the team online, as long as you're not from Australia, as the whole team is from Europe. (Even so, I've got a bot online regularly)
