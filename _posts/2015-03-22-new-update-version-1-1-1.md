<p>We have recently completed work on CatBlock 1.1.1</p>
<p>The versions for Opera and Chrome are currently pending review.</p>
<p>The changes in this version are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixes for Chrome Web Store and Opera extensions gallery.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<p>In case these versions do not get approved, we will not create a version on the changelog just yet, but once the extension has finished being reviewed, we will update the changelog.</p>
