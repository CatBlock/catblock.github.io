  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <h2>Last updated: 6th January 2016 (GMT)</h2>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-6">
  <p>We at CatBlock aim to collect as little information as possible to run the software.</p>
  <p>Currently, we collect no data directly from our users via the extension. The anonymous "ping" system from AdBlock is also removed.</p>
  <p>We do use Google Analytics on this website, which includes data related to your interests and basic information, as part of the "Demographics and Interest Reporting" feature.</p>
  <p>This uses the Google Analytics and DoubleClick (Google AdSense) cookies to gather the information, and you can opt-out of these cookies at the places listed below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Analytics at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a>
    </li>
    <li>DoubleClick (Google AdSense) at <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/</a> and/or <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>If Do Not Track is enabled in your browser settings, we do not run the Google Analytics script, so your data will not be collected.</p>
  <p>We are only presented with data in percentages, and cannot track individual users. We use the data given to us to make sure that the website serves its purpose and that people can find the information the need.</p>

  <p>By using this website and/or the CatBlock extension, you agree to any handling of any data we collect in accordance with this policy, and any future revisions to it.
